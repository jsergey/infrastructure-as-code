All configuration management code is placed under configuration folder which has subfolders for providers (puppet and chef). Below these folders we have folders containing third-party packages as [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) ([Pupppet](https://puppet.com) modules or [Chef](https://www.chef.io) cookbooks). These modules are responsible for configuring individual servers but they can also be used for application deployment.
